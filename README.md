# uftdev-aos-web-for-340-training

## Description
This test is used as a resource for the UFT Developer level 340 training.

### Caveat
As always with a UFTD test and that contains an application model. After cloning the github project, 
<span style="color:red">**the first run will fail**</span> 
because there is no application model java file, but this first run should create the file. Subsequent runs should be fine.


## Usage
This repository contains one Intellij/Java project that can be used as a solution for the first 3 use cases in the 340 training.

Since each use case is created by "building" upon the previous one, this project mimics that by having 3 branches, one for each use case. They are:


| Use Case Name                | Branch Name|
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Record/Replay/Reporting      | record-replay-report |
| Object Identification Center | oic                  |
| Application Model            | am                   |
